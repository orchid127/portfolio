# Kimberley's Portfolio

This repository is my code for a portfolio website I'm building. I'm using React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS for the front-end of the website.

## Why choosing these technologies ?

I have some experience in using React Native, but I wanted to learn how to use React Js as many modern websites uses this framework. I also decided to use Tailwind CSS since I planned on making a dark and light mode.

## Current look

For now, this is what my website looks like :

- [ ] add light mode
