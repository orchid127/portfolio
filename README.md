# Kimberley's Portfolio

You can see my website [here](https://kimberleyndouga.netlify.app/).

This repository is my code for a portfolio website I'm building. I'm using React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS for the front-end of the website. I use Netlify to deploy my website.

## Why choosing these technologies ?

I have some experience in using React Native, but I wanted to learn how to use ReactJs as many modern websites uses this framework. I also decided to use Tailwind CSS since I planned on making a dark and light mode.

## Current look

For now, this is what my website looks like :
