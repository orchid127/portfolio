                <p>Hello ! My name is Kimberley and I like to program apps and video games that are as cute as they are functional. 
                    My coding started back in middle school, when I was introduced to programming by my father, 
                    and then continued in high school when i started programming my own games in Python.
                    Now, I’m a third-year student in computer science, looking for an apprenticeship to further my skills in web development.</p>
